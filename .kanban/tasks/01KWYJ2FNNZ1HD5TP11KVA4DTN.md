    Implemented via /tdd. RED first: wrote Tests/ShellToolTests/ScaffoldTests.swift (Swift Testing @Suite/@Test, matching upstream convention) and ran `swift test` -> failed "Could not find Package.swift" (feature missing). GREEN: created Package.swift (swift-tools-version 6.2, .macOS(.v26) only), Sources/ShellTool/ShellTool.swift (comment-only scaffold module), Examples/ShellDemo/Sources/shell-demo/main.swift, and .github/workflows/ci.yml (runs-on: macos-26, swift build && swift test).

    Verification (all fresh, green):
    - `swift package resolve` exit 0 — FoundationModelsOperationTool resolved over SSH at main (9e1d368); swift-subprocess 1.0.0-beta.1; Yams 5.4.0; transitively swift-syntax, swift-argument-parser, swift-system.
    - `swift build` exit 0 — "Build complete!" all targets (ShellTool, shell-demo, Operations, OperationsCLI...).
    - `swift test` exit 0 — "1 test in 1 suite passed" (ShellToolScaffoldTests.packageScaffoldingBuildsAndTestsRun).
    - CI YAML validated with python yaml.safe_load — OK, runs-on: macos-26.

    DIVERGENCE from task text (documented in Package.swift comment): swift-subprocess is pulled from https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-subprocess.git, NOT apple/swift-subprocess. The apple/ path 404s — Apple moved the repo to the swiftlang org. Product name `Subprocess` and package identity `swift-subprocess` are unchanged. Pinned exact: "1.0.0-beta.1" (only 3-component semver tags are 1.0.0-beta.1 and 0.2.1; two-component tags like 0.5 aren't SwiftPM versions; beta.1 is the current line for macOS 26).

    Adversarial double-check (double-check agent): PASS — product/package names, target wiring, macOS-only platform, CI, and the swiftlang divergence all verified against the real dependency checkouts.

    Leaving task in `doing`, green, for /review.

    Pulled back from review to doing to resolve the open review finding.

    Finding: Tests/ShellToolTests/ScaffoldTests.swift trivial `#expect(Bool(true))`.

    Fix: removed the meaningless assertion. The `@testable import ShellTool` at the top is the real compile/link proof (only compiles if the ShellTool library target builds and exposes an importable module). Renamed the test to `moduleImportsCleanlyAndTestTargetRuns()` with an empty body and a doc comment explaining that reaching/running it under `swift test` proves the module imports cleanly and the test target executes — no tautology. The module is still a scaffold comment with no public API, so an API-exercising test intentionally lands with the implementation in later tasks (no fake coverage added).

    Verification: `swift build` exit 0; `swift test` exit 0 — 1 test in 1 suite passed, 0 failures, 0 warnings.

    Finding checklist item flipped to [x]. Leaving task GREEN in doing for the reviewer.

## What
Create `Package.swift` for the Swift package `FoundationModelsShelltool`: swift-tools-version 6.2, platform `.macOS(.v26)` only (no iOS — `Process`/posix_spawn and `/bin/sh` don't exist on iOS).

Dependencies:
- `FoundationModelsOperationTool` at `git@github.com:swissarmyhammer/FoundationModelsOperationTool.git`, branch `main` — products `Operations`, `OperationsCLI`
- `swift-subprocess` (at `swiftlang/swift-subprocess` — `apple/swift-subprocess` 404s, repo moved to the swiftlang org), product `Subprocess`, pinned exact `1.0.0-beta.1`
- `jpsim/Yams`

Targets, mirroring the upstream root-package layout (Examples as targets of the root `Package.swift`):
- `Sources/ShellTool` — library target (ops, `ShellContext`, `ShellState`, `ShellRunner`, `OutputBuffer`, `ShellPolicy`, output types), depends on `Operations`, `Subprocess`, `Yams`
- `Examples/ShellDemo/Sources/shell-demo` — executable target, depends on `ShellTool`, `Operations`, `OperationsCLI`
- `Tests/ShellToolTests` — test target, depends on `ShellTool` (`@testable`)

Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running `swift build && swift test` on a macOS 26 runner. Confirm root `.gitignore` covers `.build/` (already present) — no `.shell/`-specific top-level entry is needed since the runtime directory self-ignores via its own nested `.gitignore` (see `ShellState` in task 2).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `swift build` succeeds with all three targets resolving
- [x] `swift package resolve` pulls `FoundationModelsOperationTool`, `swift-subprocess`, and `Yams` cleanly
- [x] CI workflow file exists and is syntactically valid

## Tests
- [x] A placeholder test in `Tests/ShellToolTests` (e.g. `XCTAssertTrue(true)` or a Swift Testing `@Test` stub) passes via `swift test`

## Workflow
- Use `/tdd` — write the placeholder test first, then wire the manifest to make `swift test` pass.

## Note
`swift-subprocess` lives at `https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-subprocess.git`, not `apple/swift-subprocess` (that path 404s — Apple moved it to the swiftlang org). Product name `Subprocess` and package identity `swift-subprocess` are unchanged. See the comment in `Package.swift`.

## Review Findings (2026-07-15 08:18)

- [x] `Tests/ShellToolTests/ScaffoldTests.swift:11` — Trivial assertion `#expect(Bool(true))` that always passes without testing any real functionality. RESOLVED (2026-07-15): dropped the meaningless `#expect(Bool(true))`. The `@testable import ShellTool` at the top is the real compile/link proof; the `@Test moduleImportsCleanlyAndTestTargetRuns()` now has an empty body, so reaching and running it proves the module imports cleanly and the test target executes without a tautological assertion. `swift build` and `swift test` both green (1 test passing, 0 failures/warnings). The `ShellTool` module is still a scaffold comment with no public API, so a real API-exercising test lands with the implementation in the subsequent tasks.
